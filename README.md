# AIxAutism
AI project to ease access to autism-related scientific literature
## Overview

**AIxAutisme** is an AI-based project aiming to improve access to scientific knowledge on autism for professionals, researchers, clinical supervisors, and educators, especially in the French-speaking community.

This project combines:
- Semantic search using **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
- A curated scientific **local corpus + PubMed API updates**
- **Natural language question answering**
- **Summarization and translation** into French
- Transparent access to **scientific sources (DOI / PubMed links)**

## Problem Statement

Accessing evidence-based literature remains difficult for non-English-speaking professionals due to:
- Language barriers (most scientific publications are in English)
- Complexity of PubMed and indexing systems
- Lack of time to read, synthesize, and evaluate sources
- Absence of tailored tools for real-world use cases in health and education

## Target Users

- Health and social care professionals (e.g., psychologists, special educators, therapists)
- Researchers in autism, cognitive sciences, and education
- Clinical supervisors and scientific committees
- Trainers and academic instructors

## Stack & Tools

- **LangChain** + **ChromaDB** for vector search and document retrieval
- **OpenAI (GPT)** or **Mistral** for summarization
- **PubMed E-utilities** for automatic corpus enrichment
- **Streamlit** as the frontend interface
- Hosted locally or using **S3-compatible cloud storage**

## Hackathon Goals

During the hackathon, we aim to:
- Build a working **RAG prototype** with a local JSON corpus
- Connect to PubMed for real-time data enrichment
- Implement a **Streamlit app** for user interaction
- Enable summarization + source linking in French

## Project Status

- MVP design ready
- Sample dataset available
- Documentation, use cases and needs defined
- Looking for **technical collaborators (AI / NLP / Dev)** to build and test the prototype
